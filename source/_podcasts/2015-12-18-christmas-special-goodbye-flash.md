In the most experimental episode of the High Yield Podcast yet, this full-on radio drama and variety show extravaganza follows
PengWin as he is visited by the Ghosts of Starcraft Past, Present and Future. We celebrate and experience pain with him as he copes
with the sudden loss of Flash's Passion and looks within himself to determine what he, and each of us, can do.

**Director's Note**: This is something I have wanted to try for a long time, but I've never been in a position, had the resources
nor the inspiration to execute it exactly as I would have liked. It all came to me in a *FlaSh* when he retired, and I couldn't pass up
on the opportunity to follow my dreams. If you don't like it, please let me know, I don't want to waste time on stuff like this in the
future if it is not well received. Conversely if you *do* like it, please don't be a silent majority! Let me know your favourite parts!
Is my comedy to obtuse for you, or just the right amount? I hope you all enjoy this as much as I enjoyed making it.
